- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jack Wonnacott
- ðŸ‘€ I am from Canada, self taught in beginner HTML/CSS, with experience in NodeJS and Express. Some experience with Nginx and Web Servers
- ðŸŒ± I try to make unique and useful projects that can help many different people with different tasks.
- ðŸ§  I am always trying to learn new things and improve upon what I know!
