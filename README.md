# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

I am an HS student in Vancouver BC, self taught in NodeJS, HTML, Electron, & DiscordJS with over 3 years experience
Always looking for new methods and ways to improve my code

# A Bit About Me
I am an HS student in Vancouver, BC
Lover of Psych and Classic rock
Openly gay, and helping to try and improve mental health support and suicide prevention for LGBT youth!

Hallo! Ik spreek een beetje Nederlands!

# Some Projects:
  [RezFile](https://www.rezfile.net)
  [Discord Music Bot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=%20882000780951969822&permissions=292422011968&scope=bot)

  These projects began my coding experience, so expect bugs and pretty gnarly code. Always working to improve them!
